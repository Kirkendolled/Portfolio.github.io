            <h3>Fraud Guard</h3>
            <a href="https://www.fraudguardusa.com">Visit Website</a>
            <p>For the Fraud Guard project, I embarked on a multifaceted journey, taking on the role of both a developer and content creator. Utilizing the GoHighLevel platform, which was an entirely new realm for me, I adeptly navigated the intricacies of this CRM and mastered its unique functionalities. My development efforts were augmented by the deployment of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience.
              Given the importance of visibility in the digital landscape, I took the initiative to optimize the website for search engines, enhancing its online presence and ensuring it reaches the right audience. This SEO endeavor is a testament to my commitment to the project's overarching success.
              Furthermore, my role wasn't confined to just the technical aspects. I wore multiple hats and undertook the responsibility of content creation in its entirety. Every aspect of the Fraud Guard site, whether it's the thoughtfully designed layout, the imagery that mirrors the brand's identity, or the crafted content that communicates its vision, reflects my personal touch. My comprehensive participation showcases my wide-ranging expertise and steadfast devotion, ensuring that the Fraud Guard site is both technically sound and narratively compelling.

            <h3>Cultivated Mental Health</h3>
            <a href="https://www.cepursuits.com">Visit Website</a>
            <p>The project entailed the development of a new website for a continuing education business (startup)
               with a targeted completion period of 3-6 months. The project was initiated by conducting thorough 
               marketing and platform research which expedited the completion timeline by 2 months. The domain was 
               procured in early February and the new website was constructed, rendering it ready for publication
                by March 7, 2023. As the Project Manager, my responsibilities included tracking progress, drafting 
                guidelines, and streamlining the class and speaker selection process. Additionally, I conducted 
                extensive research to identify optimal courses for marketing and promotion purposes. I also 
                developed customized certificates, facilitated Zoom classes, and created evaluation forms. 
                Although the project is ongoing, I am sharing this update with permission from the client as 
                they have already offered several successful classes.</p>
